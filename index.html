            <h3>Qualitative Interviews</h3>
            <p>Want to better understand the users needs, goals and frustrations? I find the best way to do so is to just ask! When performing a user interview I am sure to ask open-ended question, utilize the 5-whys strategy, and avoid leading questions.
